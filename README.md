# Material UI dynamic sticky header 

## Setup
- install dependencies `npm i`
- run code `npm run start`

## Premise 

On the main branch we use MUI TableHead and such components, 
on vanilla we use the vanilla thead and such.

## Issue

When using MUI table components, at certain zoom levels, 
TableHead gets colorful border on the bottom (check the images directory for the example),
but this issue doesn't happen with vanilla elements.
